					<h1>Interest in IT</h1>
				</div>

				<div class="sectionContent">
					<p>I became interested in computing when they first came in the form of a personal desktop. IBM DOS was the first system I worked on. Despite its lack of multi tasking, it still produced great output, albeit slowly by modern standards. My interest developed on the basis of using computers to produce things, desktop publishing and later music production. </p>

					<h2>IT Helpdesk Support</h2>
					<h3>Description</h3>
					<p>We are one of Australia's leading apparel retailers with our head offices situated with easy access to public transport. We require a IT Helpdesk and Systems Support person to assist with the maintenance and development of the organisations internal IT systems to satisfy the growing needs of the business. This is an excellent opportunity for the right candidate looking for the opportunity to develop a wide range of skills.</p>
					<h3>Skills I have</h3>
					<p>It is appealing as I know I could manage being a support office in a large company. I do lack some of the specifics currently detailed, such as networking knowledge and Harmony, but with this course and some personal learning I am sure I could learn what is required. It will not be easy to get a break or a chance, but I am always optimistic. I already have some of the skills required such as Mac OS experience, a strong business acumen and understanding and communication skills for customer service.</p>
					<h3>Skills I Need & Learning Plan</h3>
					<p>The role might be one that is obtainable in the future. Being not so ambitions I might stand a chance of getting the job. Not being young places me at a disadvantage as I am not looking for a career, only a regular position for a few years. I have some experience but have no qualification in this field, so I need to complete this initially and perhaps get some recent experience in some capacity, somehow before applying for such a role.</p>

					<h2>Myers Briggs Type Indicator</h2>
					<p>Campaigners (ENFPs) are true free spirits – outgoing, openhearted, and open-minded. With their lively, upbeat approach to life, they stand out in any crowd. But even though they can be the life of the party, Campaigners don’t just care about having a good time. These personality types run deep – as does their longing for meaningful, emotional connections with other people.</p>

You are an Auditory learner!
If you are an auditory learner, you learn by hearing and listening. You understand and remember things you have heard. You store information by the way it sounds, and you have an easier time understanding spoken instructions than written ones. You often learn by reading out loud because you have to hear it or speak it in order to know it.</p>

				<h1>Project Idea</h1>
			</div>

			<div class="sectionContent">
				<article>
					<h2>Overview</h2>
					<p>Designed for IOS and Android, the application will provide up to date information on your location sourcing existing sites, governmental and commercial. The concept of a one stop shop for all relevant topics will be housed in a neat compact frame. The option for local businesses to provide offers and or specific services will assist in funding hosting and other costs on an ongoing basis.</p>
				</article>

				<article>
					<h2>Motivation</h2>
					<p>What excites us is the potential for bringing together the community in a modern way by providing the most important local feeds in one easy to use application. In addition, the potential for growth financially through sponsorship deals and advertising offers investors a solid return on their stake. Promotion of the new application can be conducted locally with easy-to-use instructions on how to run this on customers’ phones. Being a free application ensures a high level take up and data of the user base will be a useful selling point to sponsors and advertisers.</p>
				</article>

				<article>
					<h2>Description</h2>
					<p>Although the base services of the application, as described above, are minimal, these can be tailored to suit each location or zone in larger cities. The dashboard will host this service and will be sourced from relevant governmental, council or commercial services. Some of these may incur fees for the provider. From the dashboard, users can access more detailed information they may be interested in and feature a particular offer, event or emergency. Notifications will also feature this aspect of the application. Users will be encouraged to have the application open throughout updating the information on a timely basis. The concept that users need to have this on their phones to keep in touch with all things local is to be at the forefront of marketing the product</p>
				</article>

				<article>
					<h2>Tools and Technologies</h2>
					<p>A relatively simple application to design for mobile technology, ‘keeping it local’ combines existing data and presents it in a simple and easy to use format. Its footprint will be relatively small as it will not host the majority of the data, instead it will stream it into the dashboard. Logos and advertising will need to be hosted but these are quite small in size. Maintenance will be relatively simple but ensuring all live links are kept functioning and active is essential. Users will be able to select what is featured on their dashboard, but sponsors and advertisements will not be user selectable. Simple icons will be used to signify the weather or alerts which can be used to call further information.</p>
				</article>

				<article>
					<h2>Skills Required</h2>
					<p>The development team will be small and the expectation of a rapid development cycle and testing would see the application available in a short period of time. Marketing can commence during this process to build demand and excitement. The size of the resulting program must be as small as possible  and not demand any intensity in terms of battery life or memory allocation. It should be created to run in the background taking minimal resources. If this is not achievable the product will be deleted as users notice a drain or slowness in their mobile device. Staffing the development is therefore key to its success as a viable product.</p>
				</article>

				<article>
					<h2>Outcome</h2>
					<p>It is proposed the first two location be small villages or suburbs where we can ascertain quickly what functions well and what is most relevant to people. It will give us the data to use in later rollouts. It is hoped that success in carefully chosen locations will create interest and a desire for something similar in other places. Various marketing techniques will be used to encourage participation especially for businesses in the area. What it will bring to phone technology is a suite of useful data in one place relevant to the users place of residence and support local communities in. varying ways. There is not at this time any application that is this specific, most refer to much larger areas and are not personalised in this manner.
We hope that with suitable technical skills, design attributes and a modest investment to launch this product within a short time period of three to six months. In the retime we are seeking suitable start up locations.</p>
